### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**jadeadams517/jadeadams517** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the Flatiron School's Data Science immersive curriculum!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and SQL.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about: any beginner basic questions. Otherwise I am really into astrology, horseshoe crabs and gender theory :-) 
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: email me at jade.adams517@gmail.com
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: All of an adult humanâ€™s blood vessels, if laid out end to end, would be about 100,000 miles, so they could encircle the earth four times.
