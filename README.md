# My portfolio

California Reservoir Time Series Prediction- [Link](https://github.com/jadeadams517/California_Reservoir_Prediction) 
- Built time series machine learning models to predict reservoir storage levels across California
- Created a seasonal auto-regressive, moving-average model using a grid search, resulting in predicted levels within 9% of actual.
- Used statsmodels, pmdarima, and sklearn to create and test SARIMA, SARIMAX, and HWES models across evaluation statistics.

Movie Recommendation System - [Link](https://github.com/wharr1203/Chimera-Movie-Recommendations) 
- Created a movie collaborative filtering recommendation system for users of a streaming service.
- Utilized Surprise machine learning libraries to find the best recommendation model using 600 users ratings across 100,000 movies.
- Chose a singular value decomposition model using a grid search, resulting in predicted ratings within 12% of actual ratings.

H1N1 Vaccine Analysis - [Link](https://github.com/Jyve00/H1N1_Vaccine_Analysis) 
- Implemented machine learning models to predict respondents’ vaccination decision during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.
- Chose logistic regression using a grid search, and used a pipeline, resulting in an 83% prediction accuracy score.
- Performed EDA and determined doctor opinion and personal opinion on H1N1 risk and vaccine efficacy were highest predictors.

Home Sales Analysis - [Github Link](https://github.com/dmrossm/HomeSalesAnalysis) [Tableau Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jade.adams/viz/kings_county_market/MarketSummary)
- Developed a multiple linear regression model with prediction accuracy within $100k of true price and 63% higher accuracy than baseline. 
- Analyzed Pearson correlation of 20 different features for ~22,000 home sales from 2014-2015 in the Greater Seattle area.
- Built a Tableau Story overviewing the key statistics and areas of the real estate market.
